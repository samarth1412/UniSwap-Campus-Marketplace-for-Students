# 🎓 UniSwap – Campus Marketplace for Students

> **Buy, Sell, and Trade: Books, Gadgets, Furniture & More.**  
> A secure, campus-exclusive marketplace designed to connect students.

---

## Project Description

University students frequently buy and sell items such as textbooks, electronics, furniture, and daily-use items. Currently, they rely on scattered platforms like group chats, social media, or generic marketplaces that are not campus-specific, lack trust, and provide poor search and communication experiences.

**UniSwap** is a full-stack web application designed exclusively for university students to buy and sell items within their campus community.

The platform allows authenticated users to:
- Create, edit, and delete item listings with images
- Search listings using filters such as category, price, and keywords
- Communicate with buyers and sellers using real-time chat
- Save listings to a wishlist
- Report inappropriate listings

The system is developed using **Go, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript**, and built incrementally using **Agile sprints**.
